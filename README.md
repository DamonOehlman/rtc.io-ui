## Reference

### `rtc-ui/stream`

Provides a number of helper functions for rendering both local and remote
streams to the DOM.  Also provides a top level `streamui` function that chain
be used as a quickconnect "plugin" to automatically wire up these helper
functions for typical usage:

#### `streamui(qc, opts)`

Link standard quickconnect events to sensible streamui handlers.  Use `opts`
to provide configuration to the handler functions, notably:

- `container` - the container element in which new elements will be created
  within and searches for element removal will be constrained to. Defaults
  to `document.body`.

- `plugins` - If you are using any rtc.io plugins specify these here to have
  them passed on to `rtc-attach` for integration.

#### `streamui.local(container, opts?) => fn(stream)`

Create a handler function specifying a target container and any
additional options.  The handler function expects a single argument
of `stream` for which a rendering element will be created and added
to the specified container.

This element will have the `rtc` abd `localvideo` classes applied to
it so can be styled using CSS by your app.

#### `streamui.add(container, opts?) => fn(id, stream)`

Create a handler function that is designed to respond to `stream:added`
events generated by `rtc-quickconnect` (i.e it follows the `(id, stream)` function
signature).  A renderer element will be created for the stream and appended
to the `container` element.

This element will have the `rtc` and `remotevideo` classes applied to it, and
will also have `data-peer` and `data-stream` attributes set on the created
element.

#### `streamui.remove(container, opts?) => fn(id, stream?)`

Create a handler function that is designed to respond to both `stream:removed`
and `call:ended` events generated by `rtc-quickconnect`.  When the handler is
invoked with just an id, all elements with the `data-peer` matching the
specified value will be removed from `container`.  If a `stream` argument value
is supplied, then only those matching the `data-stream` label will be removed.
